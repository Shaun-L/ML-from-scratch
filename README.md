# ML-from-scratch

I am using this repository to learn and write all ML stuff from scratch just using numpy/jax/tf.

I am also planning to write everything only using vim and cli only, but we'll see how long that lasts

- Day I started: `3/24/2025`
- Day I stopped using vim: `N/A`

## Launching venv

1. Get in and update/install requirements (assuming you've initialized venv)
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate #For Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate #For Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
